# High-altitude platform station (HAPS)-assisted offloading simulations
HAPS is a high-altitude aircraft able to offer observation or communication services similarly to artificial satellites. HAPS systems are typically deployed at altitudes of 20 km, which reduces propagation latency to less than 1 ms.

## About
This repository provides simplified simulations of the HAPS-assisted offloading systems. The purpose of this simulation is to verify the offloading coefficients that can be obtained, e.g., via optimization.

## System Assumptions
In parameters setup it is possible to set the number of UEs, UAVs, and the number of tasks generated per entity. 

## Offloading Strategies
The assumptions on the offloading strategies are based on the following paper:
Y. Sadovaya, O. Vikhrova, S. Andreev, and H. Yanikomeroglu "Enhancing Service Continuity in Non-Terrestrial Networks via Multi-Connectivity Offloading"
