# HAPS-assisted offloading simulations

## About
### This repository provides simplified simulations of the HAPS-assisted offloading systems. The purpose of this simulation is to verify the offloading coefficients that can be obtained, e.g., via optimization

## System Assumptions
### In parameters setup it is possible to set the number of UEs, UAVs, and the number of tasks generated per entity 

## Offloading Strategies
### The assumptions on the offloading strategies are based on the following paper:
### Y. Sadovaya, O. Vikhrova, S. Andreev, and H. Yanikomeroglu "Enhancing Service Continuity in Non-Terrestrial Networks via Multi-Connectivity Offloading"
